# Smart-Vehicle-Parking-Management-System
Parkit- A smart vehicle parking management system that enables real-time pre-booking and uses IoT/ANPR for automated entry and exit tracking. Full-stack prototype for an IoT-integrated parking app which manages slots, checks database availability, and handles license plate recognition.

üí°Key Features
1. Seamless User Experience: Secure user login and an intuitive interface for selecting parking locations and duration.
2. Real-Time Availability: Checks the database instantly for slot availability based on the user's selected location and time duration.
3. Dynamic Suggestions: If a slot is unavailable, the system suggests alternative times or nearby locations.
4. Smart Alarm Notification: Provides a traffic-aware alarm to notify the user when they need to leave to reach the parking spot on time.
5. IoT Integration (ANPR): Uses number plate recognition at entry/exit points for automated logging and accurate time tracking.

üó∫Ô∏è Structure
Mobile-app - Mobile app source code (Client side)
Backend - API server and core business logic
